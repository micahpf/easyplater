\title{Calculate global plate design score}
\usage{
calc_pds_global(
  plate_df,
  columns_for_scoring,
  column_weights,
  internal_control_well_indices
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate_df}{Data frame of samples and associated clinical metadata variables.}

\item{columns_for_scoring}{Character vector of column names to use for scoring.}

\item{column_weights}{Numeric vector of weights to use for the variables in \code{columns_for_scoring}. Must be same length as \code{columns_for_scoring}.}

\item{internal_control_well_indices}{Numeric vector containing indices of control wells. Expecting zero index, and numbering going first top to bottom, then left to right.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar.
}
\description{
\code{calc_pds_global()} calculates \eqn{PDS_{v_x}}, the sub-score of \eqn{PDS_v} where \eqn{v} is a clinical metadata variable and \eqn{x} is a unique value of \eqn{v}, accounting for the randomization of value \eqn{x} of \eqn{v} across a plate design.
