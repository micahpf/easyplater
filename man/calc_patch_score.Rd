\title{Calculate patch score}
\usage{
calc_patch_score(
  plate_df,
  columns_for_scoring,
  column_weights,
  patch_weight = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate_df}{Data frame of samples and associated clinical metadata variables.}

\item{columns_for_scoring}{Character vector of column names to use for scoring.}

\item{column_weights}{Numeric vector of weights to use for the variables in \code{columns_for_scoring}. Must be same length as \code{columns_for_scoring}.}

\item{patch_weight}{down-weighting for \eqn{PDS_{patch}}, required because \eqn{|patches|=3(|rows|+|columns|)}. If NULL, weight is calculated automatically. Default value for 96-well plates is 1/6.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar.
