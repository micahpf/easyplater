\title{Calculate plate design score}
\usage{
calc_pds(
  plate_df,
  columns_for_scoring,
  column_weights,
  internal_control_well_indices,
  pds_local_weight = 1,
  patch_weight = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate_df}{Data frame of samples and associated clinical metadata variables.}

\item{columns_for_scoring}{Character vector of column names to use for scoring.}

\item{column_weights}{Numeric vector of weights to use for the variables in \code{columns_for_scoring}. Must be same length as \code{columns_for_scoring}.}

\item{internal_control_well_indices}{Numeric vector containing indices of control wells. Expecting zero index, and numbering going first top to bottom, then left to right.}

\item{pds_local_weight}{Numeric scalar. Weight to give the \eqn{PDS_{local}} relative to \eqn{PDS_{local}}. A sensible default is 1, but may be adjusted as desired.}

\item{patch_weight}{down-weighting for \eqn{PDS_{patch}}, required because \eqn{|patches|=3(|rows|+|columns|)}. If NULL, weight is calculated automatically. Default value for 96-well plates is 1/6. \strong{TO DO: Avi, check this description}}
